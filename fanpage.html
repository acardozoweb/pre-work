        <h4>Biography</h4>
        <p>Jeff Rosenstock was born in Long Island, New York and has been touring with various bands 
            since he was a teenager. </p>
            His first band The Arrogant Sons of Bitches quickly gained a loyal following, and that fanbase
            followed him and grew larger with his next band Bomb the Music Industry! </p>
